config RMI4_BUS
	tristate "Synaptics RMI4 bus support"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support the Synaptics RMI4 bus.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rmi-bus.

config RMI4_I2C
	tristate "RMI4 I2C Support"
	depends on RMI4_BUS && I2C
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support RMI4 devices connected to an I2C
	  bus.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rmi-i2c.

config RMI4_SPI
	tristate "RMI4 SPI Support"
	depends on RMI4_BUS && SPI
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support RMI4 devices connected to an SPI
	  bus.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rmi-spi.

config RMI4_GENERIC
	tristate "RMI4 Generic driver"
	depends on RMI4_BUS
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support generic RMI4 devices.

	  This is pretty much required if you want to do anything useful with
	  your RMI device.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rmi-generic.

config RMI4_F11
	tristate "RMI4 Function 11 (2D pointing)"
	depends on RMI4_BUS && RMI4_GENERIC
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to add support for RMI4 function 11.

	  Function 11 provides 2D multifinger pointing for touchscreens and
	  touchpads.  For sensors that support relative pointing, F11 also
	  provides mouse input.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rmi-f11.

config RMI4_F19
	tristate "RMI4 Function 19 (0D pointing)"
	depends on RMI4_BUS && RMI4_GENERIC
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to add support for RMI4 function 19.

	  Function 19 provides support for capacitive buttons for sensors
	  that implement capacitive buttons.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rmi-f19.

config RMI4_F34
	tristate "RMI4 Function 34 (device reflash)"
	depends on RMI4_BUS && RMI4_GENERIC
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to add support for RMI4 function 34.

	  Function 34 provides firmware upgrade capability for your sensor.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rmi-f34.

config RMI4_F54
	tristate "RMI4 Function 54 (analog diagnostics)"
	depends on RMI4_BUS && RMI4_GENERIC
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to add support for RMI4 function 54.

	  Function 54 provides access to various diagnostic features in
	  certain RMI4 touch sensors.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rmi-f54.

config RMI4_DEV
	bool "Synaptics direct RMI device support (rmidev)"
	depends on GPIO_SYSFS && (RMI4_I2C || RMI4_SPI)
	help
	  Say Y here to add support for rmidev.

	  The rmidev feature implements a character device providing access
	  to RMI4 sensor register maps.

	  This is not currently available as a loadable module.
