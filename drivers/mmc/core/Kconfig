config MMC_UNSAFE_RESUME
	bool "Assume MMC/SD cards are non-removable (DANGEROUS)"
	help
	  If you say Y here, the MMC layer will assume that all cards
	  stayed in their respective slots during the suspend. The
	  normal behaviour is to remove them at suspend and
	  redetecting them at resume. Breaking this assumption will
	  in most cases result in data corruption.

	  This option is usually just for embedded systems which use
	  a MMC/SD card for rootfs. Most people should say N here.

	  This option sets a default which can be overridden by the
	  module parameter "removable=0" or "removable=1".

config MMC_EMBEDDED_SDIO
	boolean "MMC embedded SDIO device support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say Y here, support will be added for embedded SDIO
	  devices which do not contain the necessary enumeration
	  support in hardware to be properly detected.

config MMC_PARANOID_SD_INIT
	bool "Enable paranoid SD card initialization (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say Y here, the MMC layer will be extra paranoid
	  about re-trying SD init requests. This can be a useful
	  work-around for buggy controllers and hardware. Enable
	  if you are experiencing issues with SD detection.

config MMC_SD_CHECK_BOOT_SIGNATURE
	bool "Safety for uSD card short circuit"
	default n
	help
	  If you say Y here, uSD driver checks boot signature
	  in MBR when detecting uSD card.If boot signature(0xAA55)
	  is invalid, uSD driver considers it as broken or
	  unformatted card and turns SD_VDD off.This avoids
	  abnormal behavior(e.g over current by short mode) with
	  cracked uSD.

config MMC_ENABLE_BKOPS
	bool "Enable background operations"
	default n
	help
	  If you say Y here, use of the background operations option
	  will be enabled, if supported. This sets the BKOPS_EN flag in
	  the eMMC which is "one time programmable" i.e. once set it cannot
	  be unset.
